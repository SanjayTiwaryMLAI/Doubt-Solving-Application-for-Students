Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The `DoubtSolver` class handles PDF navigation and question answering.
2. It maintains a rolling context of the last 5 pages (configurable) using a `deque`.
3. The `next_page()` and `previous_page()` methods allow navigation through the PDF.
4. The `answer_question()` method searches the context for relevant information. This is a simple implementation and can be improved with more sophisticated NLP techniques.
5. The `main()` function provides a command-line interface for interacting with the application.

To use this application:

1. Replace `"path/to/your/pdf/file.pdf"` with the actual path to your PDF file.
2. Run the script.
3. Use the menu options to navigate through the PDF and ask questions.

This implementation provides a basic framework for a doubt-solving application. To make it more robust and effective, you could consider the following enhancements:

1. Implement more sophisticated question-answering logic, possibly using NLP libraries or external APIs.
2. Add support for handling multiple PDFs or other document formats.
3. Improve the user interface, perhaps by creating a graphical interface using a library like PyQt or Tkinter.
4. Implement user authentication to support multiple teachers and students.
5. Add features like bookmarking, highlighting, or note-taking.
